# QuantAlgs
 QuantAlgs is an algorithm that aims at allowing basic quantum algorithms to be solved using one line of code only. The first version integrates the following algorithms: Bernstein-Vazarani (berVaz), Deutschâ€“Jozsa (deuJoz), Grover Search (groveSearch) and Shor's Factoring Algorithm (shor).
